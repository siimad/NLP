2. **Generate API credentials:**
   - Go to your Kaggle account settings: https://www.kaggle.com/settings/account <!--markdownlint-disable-line-->
   - Click "Create New API Token"
   - This downloads `kaggle.json`

3. **Place `kaggle.json` in the correct location:**

   **On Windows:**

   ```bash
   # Create the .kaggle directory in your user home
   mkdir %USERPROFILE%\.kaggle
   
   # Place kaggle.json in this directory
   # C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.kaggle\kaggle.json
   ```

   **On macOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
   # Place kaggle.json in ~/.kaggle/
   chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json  # Set correct permissions
   ```

4. **Verify setup:**

   ```bash
   kaggle datasets list
   ```

   If this works without errors, you're all set!

### Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook african_wildlife_analysis.ipynb
```

Then navigate to the notebook in your browser and run cells sequentially (Cell → Run All, or run individual cells with Shift+Enter).

## Project Structure

### Part A: Classical Computer Vision Analysis

The notebook begins with fundamental image processing techniques:

1. **Library Setup** - Import TensorFlow, OpenCV, and related libraries
2. **Dataset Exploration** - Load and explore 1,504 wildlife images (376/class)
3. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Grayscale conversion for comparison with original images
   - Gaussian blur and median filtering for noise reduction
4. **Edge Detection**
   - Canny edge detector for clean, well-defined edges
   - Sobel operators for directional edge information
5. **Contour Analysis** - Identify continuous boundaries and shapes

**Key Findings:**

- Zebras remain distinctive even in grayscale due to unique stripe patterns
- Edge detection clearly separates elephants (trunk/ears) and zebras (stripes) from other species
- Buffalo and rhinos become increasingly similar without color information—foreshadowing classification challenges
- Median filtering outperforms Gaussian blur on wildlife images with complex textures

### Part B: Deep Learning Classification

The second phase implements automated species classification:

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Create balanced training subset (150 images/class)
   - Resize to 224×224 pixels (MobileNetV2 input size)
   - Normalize to [0,1] range

2. **Transfer Learning Model**
   - Base: MobileNetV2 pretrained on ImageNet (2.26M parameters, frozen)
   - Custom head: Global Average Pooling → Dense(128) + ReLU → Dropout(50%) → Dense(4) + Softmax
   - Trainable parameters: Only 5,124 (0.23% of total)
   - Model size: 8.63 MB (suitable for mobile deployment)

3. **Training**
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Loss: Categorical cross-entropy
   - Epochs: 10
   - Batch size: 32

4. **Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix analysis
   - Per-class performance metrics
   - Misclassification analysis

**Key Findings:**

- Perfect classification (100%) for highly distinctive species (elephant, zebra)
- 90% accuracy on rhino despite morphological similarity with buffalo
- Primary error (80%): Rhino → Buffalo confusion due to similar body structure, coloration, and missing horn visibility
- Transfer learning proves highly effective—achieves 95.83% accuracy training only 0.23% of parameters

## Analysis Highlights

### Visual Distinctiveness Determines Performance

- **Elephant:** Unique trunk, large ears, massive body → 100% accuracy
- **Zebra:** Distinctive black-white stripes → 100% accuracy
- **Buffalo:** Similar to rhino when horn isn't visible → 96.67% accuracy
- **Rhino:** 90% accuracy, primary challenge is rhino→buffalo confusion

### Transfer Learning Effectiveness

Despite limited training data (150 images/class), transfer learning achieved 95.83% accuracy by leveraging ImageNet features (1.4M images). The approach demonstrates that fundamental visual features (edges, textures, shapes) learned on everyday objects transfer effectively to wildlife classification.

### Interpretability Through Classical CV

Classical computer vision analysis (edge detection, contours) provided crucial insights into why deep learning succeeds or fails, enabling systematic debugging and improvement planning.

## Practical Applications

This technology enables:

- **Automated Camera Trap Analysis** - Process millions of wildlife monitoring images with 95%+ accuracy
- **Rapid Species Surveys** - Field workers can quickly identify species using mobile apps
- **Anti-Poaching Systems** - Automated rhino detection (90% accuracy) can trigger protection alerts
- **Ecological Research** - Large-scale automated classification for population and habitat analysis
- **Conservation Education** - Mobile apps to engage tourists and collect wildlife sighting data

## Understanding the Confusion Matrix

The model's primary error (rhino→buffalo) reveals important insights:

```txt
Rhino → Buffalo (4 cases, 80% of errors):
- Both share similar heavy body structure
- Similar dark gray-brown coloration
- Rhino horns not always visible in images
- Both inhabit similar savanna habitats
```

**Improvements to reduce this error:**

- Collect training images emphasizing horn visibility
- Implement attention mechanisms for head regions
- Use targeted data augmentation for problematic angles
- Fine-tune deeper model layers for more task-specific learning
